I like to work towards projects. I like achieving something I am willing to share.
That being said, there comes a time with projects where I just don't feel like updating them.
When that happens, I decide to abandon them. If for some reason you would like to look at my 
older (and potentially less quality work) then you can find them within this folder.

If for some reason you know about a project that isn't present here, feel free to make an issue commit and ask about it
if I still have the files, I'll probably upload it here.
I will not update or support old projects like I do new ones though.

Feel free to include them within modpacks or whatever
Do not reupload them.
Do not monetize them.
Link back to this github if possible, so others know where they come from

Live project should be available elsewhere.

uhhh... yeah
